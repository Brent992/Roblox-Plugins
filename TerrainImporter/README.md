# Custom Terrain Importer

This plugin is an attempt to replicate how Roblox's terrain importer feature was originally intended to work, allowing you to open PNG files from your desktop to be imported as a terrain heightmap or colormap instantly!

## Installation

This plugin can be assembled as a local plugin for free using [rojo](https://github.com/rojo-rbx/rojo).

You can also purchase it for a small fee through Roblox Studio's plugin market if you'd like to support the development of future plugins from me:<br/>
